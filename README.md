# Practice Timer
A chrome extension for organizing practice sessions. Includes timer for each exercise, metronome. 


# TODO:

* Move timer into separate component under utility.
* Make "state" directory and move store.js into it. 
* Move state template object into separate file.
* Start documenting view state schema and appilcation API.
* Can we simplify storage model so exercises not shared but copied to different sessions?
